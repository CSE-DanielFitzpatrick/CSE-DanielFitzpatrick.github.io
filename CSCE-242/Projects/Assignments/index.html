        <p>Though many people fear sharks it is a common misconception that sharks try to harm humans. The reason people are attcked is because the sharks confuse them for other sea animals that they often eat. The Atlantic ocean has the most recorded shark attacks. The waters off the coast of Florida are heavily infested with sharks. </p>
